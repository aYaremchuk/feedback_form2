FeedbackForm is a simple application build on Laravel 5 Framework.

On home page you can leave your feedback that should include:
- First name and Last name (Two capitalized words)
- Birthday (Your age should be placed between 17 and 65 years)
- Meeting date (Should be in future)
- Attachment (file in format doc, docx, pdf)

After feedback creation you will be redirected on page where you can find information about scheduled meeting.

All feedback can be found on page localhost:8000/feedbacks
